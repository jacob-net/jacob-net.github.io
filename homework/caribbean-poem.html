   <h1>Easter Week 12 Homework</h1>
    <h4>This poem is called 'I Am Caribbean'. I chose this poem because it was a fun childrens Caribbean poem.</h4>
    <h2>I Am Caribbean</h2>
    <p>I am from the Caribbean -</p>
    <p>Where the sun is hot,</p>
    <p>But the breeze is cool.</p>
    <p>I am from the Caribbean -</p>
    <p>Where flowers are bright,</p>
    <p>And so are the kites.</p>
    <p>I am from the Caribbean -</p>
    <p>Where the sand is white,</p>
    <p>But sometimes black.</p>
    <p>I am from the Caribbean -</p>
    <p>Where a girl is a gyal,</p>
    <p>And a boy is a bwoi.</p>
    <p>I am from the Caribbean -</p>
    <p>Where the islands are many,</p>
    <p>But the people are one.</p>
    <br>
